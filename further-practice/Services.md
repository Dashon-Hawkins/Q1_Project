**EXERCISE 2: mathService**

For this exercise you will be building a simple application which contains a form where a user can select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide and power) and two numbers and when the form is submitted, the value expression is returned.

All of your calculation logic for the operations should be contained in a service - your controller should have a **very** minimal amount of code.

You should be using the new folder structure and angular router for this application. Although you only need one route, it's good practice!

It should function like (and look far better than) this:

**EXERCISE 3: todoService**

For this exercise you will be building a todo app will full CRUD (no backend required). It should have the following requirements

- a user should be able to create a todo only when there is text present (use angular form validation!)
- a user should see all of their created todos with the option to delete a single todo
- a user should be able to edit each individual todo. This involves showing/hiding a new form for editing the text of a todo

All of your logic to create, show, updated and delete todos should be inside of a **service**.

You should be using the new folder structure and angular router for this application. Although you only need one route, it's good practice!

It should function like (and look far better than) this:
